# XO GAME

I made XO game using HTML, CSS, javaScript.

## Approach:

The main process is to compare the Id div with the 2D array values. If they are matched then the player name will save into the array. In addition, there is a counter for each player.
add the plyers moves to a 2d array
then checking for winners every time
